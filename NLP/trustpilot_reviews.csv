To mention here my recent experience with one of your customer service staff Muralidhar Shetty who provides his valuable service at Sharjah International Airport. First and foremost, Muralidhar greets his customers with his contagious smile which brighten ups even a doomed day. He works one step ahead by providing the best rates and time frame which is beneficial to the customers in terms of monitory considerations. Processing time taken to finish the transaction is minimal along with good customer service etiquette. One out of the box experience I have noticed is every customer leaves the counter with a smile. There may be a numerous in-depth qualities Muralidhar has adapted and executing while at work but above are a few I noticed at my very short time while doing a transaction at Sharjah Airport. I sincerely wish Muralidhar a brighter future and career with UAE Exchange as having such team is an asset on its own to the organisation while their small friendly gestures speak a million towards the organisation.

Three times we were refused to exchange amount over ......AED because of different requirements to provide additional documents. Each time the required list of document was different. When I requested brunch manager to provide the official list of documents, she advised that it is only for internal use. So there is a question: HOW YOUR CLIENT SHOULD KNOW THE INFORMATION IF IT IS FOR INTERNAL USE AND IF EVEN YOUR STAFF DO NOT KNOW IT. On the request to make written clarification of refuse, I received second rejection. On the question why they are giving incorrect information first two times, they smile. My strong advise to your organisation to keep information open and clear, better in front of the customer service window, to hire more qualified staff or to provide training for them to be aware of all company requirements.",0

950,"Dear UAE Exchange, Ref UAE Exchange Customer support Request ID :**3624745** Your customer support is one of the worst I have come across. Even after visiting your branch, multiple emails, and follow-ups, and calling your customer support on the 600 support number where an unwary user is charged at 18 fils/ minute, the matter is still unresolved for last 18 days. Since I have no other option, I am forced to put this up on trusted reviews website on that hope that the matter reaches those who matter at UAE Exchange Please have a and look into it seriously. Refer(Transaction # 9546736018703579) on 26th December 2018 was done as re-initiation for three previous canceled transactions (9546735618741193, 9546735718198795 and 9546735818184991). The Transaction No 9546736018703579 was The amount was not credited to the account even after 4 days. First, we followed it up on 30 December 2019 and was informed that the transaction has been canceled and a request has bill given to the back end team for reinitiating the transaction and we will be getting an SMS/ email after the re-initiation has been done UAE Exchange. Nothing was heard from UAE Exchange, so we followed up again by your customer support by phone (600 number again) on 2nd January 2019 and they informed that the transaction has been autocancelled and re-initiation has not been done as promised. After 45 minutes of talking to your customer support, I was informed that again a request for re-initiation of the transaction has been done to your technical team and as we will be getting an SMS/ email with the new reinitiated transaction. Please look up the customer support request ID **3624745** and see how it has been so far handled by your customer support people. This is in regard to failed transactions from 24 December 2018 and till today (11 Jan 2018) even after 18 days you can credit the money into the beneficiary account. Calling your customer support on the 600 555 550 number is a frustrating and painful experience with waiting times up to 15 minutes to even connect to a customer support person, as we are put on hold eternally after connecting to your 600 number. And an average call to your customer support takes a total time 40-45 minutes to call to get even a promise of something to be done ( Forget about a resolution of the issue). And it is further shameful that UAE Exchange customers are charged at a rate of 18 fils/ minute for their customer support call due to unprofessional service at your end. Please have the courtesy to make the service free. Fleecing an already troubled customer will be counterproductive in the long run. In the online remittance system, a few quality controls on the number of digits for account numbers for various banks in India, accepted by your system is essential. While adding a beneficiary your online portal does not allow even a space or dash in the bank address column, whereas if a customer adds a bank account number that has a mismatch on the total number of the digits accepted by each bank in India, it does not recognize this. It accepts the beneficiary with wrong digits of bank account number, readily activated after 4 hrs, and was allowed to transact to this account repeatedly for three transactions. And not a single email or SMS regarding the cancellation was send to the customer regarding the non-credit/ wrong number in bank account number total digits) We pulled out the SBI bank account number initially from SBI online, It had six zeroes prefixed to the 11 digit bank number. While adding the beneficiary we prefixed the six zeroes and then the 11 digit SBI ac number. Your system readily accepted the same, the beneficiary was validated and approved after 4 hours. So we readily remitted to the bank using that 17 digit a/c number. The first transaction was made on 22 Dec, second on 23 and 3rd on 24 Dec. No SMS/email/call regarding the failure of a transaction or an improper A/c number was notified by UAE Exchange. So we continued sending the amount to the same number. Only after the non-receipt of the amount in the beneficiary account, I followed up and came to know that there was an issue with the a/c number. Upon visiting your branch they immediately told me that there are only 11 digits in the SBI A/c number and there are no six zeros prefixed. At the branch your system won’t accept such wrong a/c numbers, but how come they are accepted in your online money transfer. We, customers, are clueless about the number of digits accepted by the payment system of UAE exchange or international transfer. A South Indian Bank account with two zeroes in front of the number had no issues in the transaction, whereas six zeroes prefixed to the numbers in SBI account number did no go through. And in the event of any such cancellations/ improper A/c numbers, we expect the UAE Exchange to let us know immediately by email/SMS that there is a cancellation, and further blockage of the wrong beneficiary a/c details so that such wrong transfers are not repeated like these. Kindly request you to resolve the canceled transaction Transaction # 9546736018703579) at the earliest.( UAE Exchange Customer support Request ID :**3624745**) This kind of pathetic service makes a mockery of UAE Exchange’s promise - ‘Service is our Currency’ Regards Avinash",2

After all that waiting, from day one they give the same response ""it will get credited in next 2-3 days"". Now i am on my 5th day i am not even sure whether they will even credit my money on 8th day. Because of this i had to suffer losses as i was not able to payback my emi on time. Can Uae exchange bear those losses?? And i forgot to mention, they never revert back to your emails. I would never use or recommend uae exchange anymore i m really fed up",0
957,Very irresponsible service. Took more than 5 days to get my money credited. They dont have atoll free customer care and a minimal number of call centre staff. you would have to spend at least 50 aed to get your call connected to a customer service executive. So pathetic,0

No staple Mark's,writing, cuts or notes with a lot of bands.

I requested a refund and was informed that will take 1 hr but when i called after 1 hr was told 2 weeks to process. Better go into a branch and save the headache if you want to send money. Avoid the online web transfer and mobile app.",0

It's December 12th 2018 and the money hasn't reached my account in Canada yet. I called their toll free number and wasted 40 minutes only to learn that they can't check the transactions that were not done online! I called RBC and they told me they have nothing pending for my account. The advice that I got from the agent online? To call the branch! Yes to call an international number to see where my money is after 3 weeks. Nor my husband, neither I are in the UAE and no one seems to take responsibility of telling us what has happened to the funds. Terrible and unreliable service, God knows how long they are going to drag it till they send us the money. Never again!!!!!!",0

1350,"There seems to be something of a disconnect somewhere in the customer relations management platform which means you will have to re-explain yourself to several different people when trying to resolve an issue. I had an issue caused by a poor response time to an email (I had to follow up as there was no response within three days, leading to a cancelled trade). I had a nightmare experience where I was told that I was going to have to restart the transaction at a worse exchange rate, despite the problem being completely the fault of UAE Exchange. Eventually, I found Litto (one of their employees) who was a god-send. He listened to my frustration, understood my problem, worked on a solution and updated me as he did so. 5 stars for Litto! 3 stars for UAE Exchange. The problem was eventually resolved and all is now well. Advice to those using the online platform to send currency: you need to lock in the trade before you send the money -- this is not made clear on the website and is problematic because you are supposed to write the transaction number when you send the money (which is only known once you have requested the trade). Secondly, the maximum amount they say you can send is not actually the maximum amount. You need to send slightly less (fees will push the amount over the limit). Finally, don't rely on emails to resolve problems -- you need to call. If you need someone to solve a complex problem, Litto is your man. Advice to UAE Exchange: on your online platform, you should tell customers when they begin the process and choose the bank not to send the money until the order is complete (explicitly tell the customer when it is okay to pay). Maybe this is obvious to some people, but I was new to these types of platforms and this small detail led to a bunch of problems. Also, you need to ensure your customer service reps are noting down issues and linking them on the CRM system so customers don't have to repeat themselves.",0

2382,Why is UAE Exchange doing currency discrimination on basis of colour of USD. I had a horrible experience and came to know that USD is not a one currency. At the UAEEXCHANGE store USD of white colour and USD of blue colour are two different products and have two different rates. 1. Details of Events :- I have been to UAE Exchange Mirdif city center branch (and have audio recording of entire incident as well). The rate of USD - AED is different on the basis of colour of USD . (yes horrific truth. ) i.e. if USD is of blue colour then rates are higher than if USD is of white Colour. No one is ready to give it in written. Subsequently I had called customer care and they said the rates are same for any colour of USD and best rate is 3.665. At the store the rate for white USD is 3.65 and blue usd is 3.665. When I insisted for the same in writing the store people back tracked. They said the rate will be same as on board i.e. 3.65. Comment USD () AED () a) Blue colour 1 usd (Blue Colour colour) = 3.665 AED b) White colour 1 usd (White colour) = 3.650 AED Consequence of Asking above in written Any Colour 1 USD= 3.650 AED Which means if UAE Exchange is doing something which they cannot give in written then its not transparent way of doing business. If we ask for details then the rate of USD- AED changes. That’s is horrible trade practice. Most Important :- If UAE-Exchange considers USD as two different product on basis of colour then why not mention it on your board. Why do you mention this as one single currency and do all this verbal discussion.,0

I am completely satisfied with the services of UAE Exchange. But on the other hand I would also like to add where they need betterment to be at number one in this competitive world. One is they have good competition with RAK bank where they not only provide competitive rates, also provide credit days as well by paying through RAK credit card. Not only this you can transfer the funds instantly as well to your home country. Also, they have to look for offering better exchange rate for currency exchange so that in this field also UAE exchange will be number one.

Its been over a week and their customer service is not responding to my emails. I have waited over an hour on the phone and they never answer their phones.",0

2879,Very good experience,2
2880,"Their staff is so prompt in responding to reviews here at Trustpilot with bunch of regrets and assurances. Truth is, their support team will never get back to tickets in less than 3 days. And even when they do, it's never one where the issue is resolved. There's always an excuse for a delay from their end. Their online service is the worst I've experienced. To people reading these reviews before considering using their service, my word - Avoid. If you're sending a large amount, and if it's urgent, they will lock your funds and delay in transferring it. If there's any issue in a transfer, they will drag it out for weeks. Starting to seem like a very shady business to me. There's no two ways about this, they are either intentionally being a scam and wasted my time and money, or they aren't just ready for an online service. This was a poor business experience, one that I've never faced with any other exchange before. Avoid.",2
2881,"Very bad service. Been dealing with their Aweer branch, but service has gone from bad to worse. Time taken to complete a transaction is unacceptable. Flash transfers do not get transferred like they promise. Worst still, they don't even let you know when a transfer gets delayed.",0

2884,UAE Bangalore Rajajinagar branch is big cheaters. I gave 5 lakhs cheque to transfer to Canadain Dollers. They told that currency is sold out at 1:30 PM on Sep10th. next day they told currency is 56.30 and taxes 1500. And they transferred only 8758 Canadian Dollars. Means 56.30 *8758 +1500=494575= I asked what about remaining 5500 rupees they told commission to NAFEX . its a big cheating. Don't trust UAE any more,2

When I was searching for a money exchange to send money to my daughter who had started her University education in 2014 in one of the South East Asian countries, which was not a popular destination, I couldn't find any other place in Oman which had the facility to send money to that particular country. But fortunately I was able to find your organization and that was a great relief for me. According to my knowledge your organization was the only one which had connections with the banks of that country at that time. Therefore I would like to pay my highest gratitude to your organization and also for the excellent service you have been providing for me since 2014. I would also like to pay my highest gratitude to all the staff members of the Wadi Kabir Branch who had rendered an excellent service to me. They were always friendly and we're always ready to serve the customers. Thanks again for all of you for the excellent service you all provide for the customers. Long live Oman UAE Exchange.",2

I have been under the impression that UAE exhange offers one of the lowest rates for foriegn exchange. However, experience has convinced me that they do offer competitive rates. The employees at UAE Exchange are really froendly and I have witnessed how patiently they deal witj some of the customers. They are also active in serving the society as evidenced by their active cooperation with many social welfare projects such as the expatriate pension scheme for the NRI s from Kerala. UAE Exchange needs to reach out to more customers and convince them of their competitive services. As of now, many are under the impression that UAE exchange is only rather mostly for affluent expatriates whose children pursue education in European countries. I wish UAE Exchange all the very best.",0

It comes to my notice why its not credited on that time i have paid, usually its real time experience, so I waited 24hours but still not credited then I called customer service the reason they gave me is , “Sewa did not accept my payment” , and they advised me to call Sewa office” . I’ve asked other that paying Sewa also they said theres no problem when they are paying. Then on August 14, i refunded my payment becuase this is the also the due date and I paid on the Etisalat Machine and no problem at all. The Branch Manager told that there’s is technical problem. (for 4days what is this?) My point is, you need to contact the customer when you know there is a problem so we can resolve the issue immediately. (If i have paid short you are contacting like Al Nahda branch) I have suggest also the customer service representative to be trained more how to handle customer.",0

3046,"I was disappointed in your promotion last July and your staff in Abubaker Metro Station. I did a transaction to join the promotion in free watch. July 31 they said out of stock. Then they photocoy my documents and said they will call me or recieve a call when i went august to follow-up they i will recieved a call once ok. Then today i went in the branch to follow-up in a super nice gesture and sweet voice. But instead the front lady is giving me a selfie stick and said no more Watch. With a gesture ""mam tangapn nyo na po ito"" (accept this). But i said ate sorry i cant. Then she said i should go there early so i can claim cause no more watch. I told her Miss your staff said i will recieve a call to pick up i just did my luck today. She said nothing and the other said mam if ever we will get again we will keep for you. When i came back to ask the customer service i said i will complain she said its ok complain in that no. Mam. I dont know if it is intention to deliver that word or helpful to suggest. My point is Can someone explain that the promotion is not until supplt last it is said Until July 31 transaction. I hope next time be prepared to this kind of volume in your promotion. Cause i was really dismayed and upset to this it was my first time supposedly to get something after 8yrs here using your service.. Im promoting your UAE Exchange as well to some friend who was sender to other remittance due to lots of promotions. Arnnie",2

3422,"Hello, Greetings from Rohan Harish Kumar Anjar! I can write for days about my experience at UAE EXCHANGE. Well, I believe this a one stop Place for Everyone to send money to their family, friends, colleagues etc. In any part of the world. They have the most convenient options to send money across, want to send a bank transfer? Yes, available. Want to send directly to the person? Yes, available. Want to send the money on immediate basis(flash)? Yes, available. May it be any currency, it is always available with them. Their buying and selling rates are one the most best and efficient compared to everyone around. I guess they are too good be compared, that’s what I feel ! UAE EXCHANGE, doesn’t only build a relation with you for sending/exchanging money. They put their hand forward in many ways for you to us (customers) to be happy and fulfilled with their services for example: they come with the most unique and different customer loyalty programs. They believe in returning back something for good ! Conducting lucky draws for their customers is very special not only a way to attract but to build a trust within everyone that you don’t go empty handed from here. While, I myself got a amazing watch from UAE EXCHANGE after my 4 transactions. This i was their one of the Customer loyalty program. No matter which ever store you visit you will always find a helpful stuff and one the most jolly representatives present at their front desk. They always greet you with a positive vibe and well behaved gesture. It is said it right your employees are your pillars and they have a strong as well as gentle pillars. Every time I visit uae echanage with a query, I return back with a most satisfied answer, they are very clear and transparent with everything which leaves me with no confusions. I may not know everything about them, but I’m sure they extremely good at everything. I recommend everyone my friends/family/colleagues to visit UAE exchange. I would like to add one more thing before I conclude, uae exchange stores a very convenient and easily accessible to everyone and that’s the best part about them! Keep doing the great job!

I was so upset and I didn't expect this service from UAEXCHANGE !! I been many times and this the first branch was SO BAD!

It is because of the services of one Gentleman Mr.Divakara Nayak Kuradka, I am forced to visit this outlet as and when a requirement arises for me. I would sincerely suggest that the outlet should provide a separate counter or isolated space for a regular customer like me( if I may say so because of the regular and volume of transactions I do), as the counters are generally crowded and am forced to stand in a line. The above is a humble suggestion and hope the management takes note of the same. Otherwise, I would continue my loyalty with UAE Exchange as long as Divakara is out there.

4564,"After a long tiring day from work, I headed to UAE Exchange JLT Branch to send money to my Mom. The moment I got off the train and took the escalator, I saw a long line of people by the counter, all are of different nationalities and from different walks of life, waiting patiently for their turn. Upon seeing the queue, I thought of just going home, call it a day and just send the money tomorrow. But somehow, a little voice inside me said, ""Patience is a virtue. If all these people can wait for a little while, then why can't you?"". So I stayed and joined the queue. That was when I realized that all these people are also working professionals. I saw security guards, accountants, nurses, all lining up, wanting the same thing- to be able to send money to our loved ones. And the amazing thing about it is that these people look more excited than tired. Excited to be able to send money home and let our loved ones have a taste of the fruit of our labor, and our sacrifices in a foreign land. I also realized on that queue that there was no white, no brown, no black, no male or female- just people. People who got the reward of their hardwork and is sharing it with others. I smiled despite myself. When it was finally my turn, I was a bit emotional because of my sudden epiphany. Good thing Kuya Lynard, the amazing staff who took care of my transaction by the counter, greeted me with such a cheerful smile. While he was processing my transaction, we had a little chat about our home country, since we're both from the Philippines. He told me, ""It's not easy being away from home. That's why UAE Exchange is here to connect us back home and make us feel as though we are home."" And he couldn't be more right.",2

If i ever need to refer some on for any CS attitude, defifnitely she will be the one. And i believe she might have impressed so many others by her excellent knowledge and skills, warmth and respect and genuine commitment towards customers. I wish her all the best and success.

4643,"Simply the best! UAE Exchange (Dibba Branch in particular as it is where i am making 90% of transactions) for me can be described as RELIABLE, TRANSPARENT, and EXCELLENT! Reliable - as they give you the best rate and the assurance that your transaction is credited. To give you an example, way back early 2015, where i was still in a mood of trying out different money exchange companies, i came to know that one transaction was not credited. When i noticed it, I sent an email to all exchange companies, and among them, only with UAE exchange i was impressed on how they deal with the situation and their proof presented. From that date onwards, all my transactions are only made with UAE exchange. Transparent - they do not have hidden charges unlike others. Excellent - this refers to their associates - Murad and Princess are stars of their Dibba Branch! All their associates deal with you in a professional way with a smile. Thank you UAE Exchange and expect for more transactions from me and my colleagues!",2

4774,I have been sending money to the Philippines since I came here in UAE in 2009. From that time till present I am satisfied with the service. Though there came a time that my mother in law find a difficulty in claiming the money because the sister company ( MLhuiller) was so rude and strict to the point that they have doubted my mom if she is really the one in the picture in her ID and why the money is a large amount. She went home frustrated and didn't claim the money. They contacted us and we advise to present another valid ID. The following day she came back but the teller gave another reason saying the control number was wrong. Then again she went home without the money. On the third day she tried to go to Palawan and there she gave the same ID and control number she was able to claim the money. I write this for your own review and for the betterment of your service. Thank you very much!,2

But generally, I love their services compare to others. And I have been choosing uae exchange over other companies for over 2yrs now. Keep up the good work, guys! Happy customer here! 😊",2

5156,"Staff Name: Rajina Branch: Burj Khalifa Metro Review: I think for me, customer service starts with how well you are served from the initial stage of your need. I have been visiting this branch for several months now, and yes, the customer service is excellent. However, i must commend the lady ""Rajina"" who has always been the welcoming partner (for lack of a better word) at the entrance. She is one of the best employees i must say i admire the most. Yes, she never gets to sit on a chair (as i always find her standing and moving around) like the other representatives but she always has a smile on her face as she welcomes each and every guest, explaining to them what the rates are at, and more so, prioritizing the customers as they come. For me, service is not only at the counter but the forefront of all of it. Honestly, she is the reason i go this branch, after work and on my way home because, i get to know the rates before making any transactions or queuing up to be served. She definitely takes my vote 101%.",2

5725,"First of all this exchange takes alot of time. The worst thing about my last ever transaction with them is, at the minute of payment i asked the guy name Monir whats the conversation rate he told me its 321 when i reached home and checked again because there were alot of difference the rate which i got is 319. I got shocked and decided not to do any transaction with them any more. One more thing total 3 times they have forced me to make UAE gold card while already i have gold card which ofcourse not with me. The gold card is for BD 1. Well i know that gold card is free of cost but they charge 1 bd don't know to put in their pocket or company gets it. 3rd time i let the guy to lie on my face by saying i don't have gold card. i let him make it for the 3rd time and then he deducted 1 bd from my transaction amount.. I was damn sure its free so they refused to give my 1 bd back then while standing there i call their head office spoke to them and they have confirmed its free and then luckily i got my 1 bd back. 3rd thing they add points on each transaction. some good guys working their use those points mean (1 bd or 2 bd ) to deduct transaction fees or adjust with the payment.. while other crooks forcefully make you buy viva credit or send the recharge to other country at double price. So cheap! I am fully p**issed off on the guy name Monir lied to me on my face and rob me openly. I am never ever gonna make any transaction with them, i use to do my company transactions 20k to 50k then again i found them cheating. as per my experience the best exchange is BFC, Lulu Exchange (even though i hate lulu group) Modern Exchange. Zenjex (worst of the worst) don't even dare to step inside. By the way BBK Lite is new in market, never tried it.",2

6116,"The money transfer and prepaid cards work well for the most part and the branch services are great too. However the problems start when you face a hitch and need to approach their customer services for back up. I activated online money transfer using their app, and it did not get activated in 3 days as promised. I contacted customer services on multiple occasions and it took 6 weeks before I could transfer money online. The experience was repeated when my wife activated her online transfer facility! Then there was a similar experience with their Gocash prepaid card, which worked well for a year, but left me stranded in Italy, unable to use it due to a PIN change error as their system had not logged my PIN change, leading to ""wrong PIN"" error message, and no international support system! That took another 2 months and multiple messages to sort out!",0

6644,"Staff were very helpful and considerate, im in ibn battuta, there was one time i needed to pay my credit card which is due on that day but then i forgot my cash, my friend who is working in moe ask the staff if he could pay instead coz he got cash and he has my credit card detail aswel they said yes, while other exchange company declined saying that the card holder should pay personally, so i was able to pay on time and escape from possible penalty for not paying on due date.. i trully am grateful for the consideration of your staffs😊",2
6645,I trust UAE exchange,2
6646,The Teller in uae exchange located al falah st. Needs to be more focus at work. I sent money to fujairah for emergency use then angelica the teller asked me what is the nationality of receiver i said jordanian but she wrote still Filipino! Unfortunately uae exchange in fujairah cannot release the money unless i need to go back and change the nationality. The Service provided by angelica (uae exchange) is not reliable at all. It wasted our time and taxi fare!,0

Called uae exchange office and they couldn't help as transaction was done online. Called the number 08000698885 given by branch and even though i was first in call queue, the call was answered in 38 minutes and advisor couldn't answer anything. Wasted 15 pounds on call charges from my mobile. On website, they are also advertising that no transfer fee however i was charged fee. The advisor kept apologising and didn't know what to answer. Really poor service",0

I received a call in the middle of the night between 12:20am, lady informed me that someone from Melbourne will be call me in 10 mins to update me. from that time, up until now I didn't received any call from them. instead I called up there local office many times, after calling them yesterday and today, finally one person answered the call and he acknowledge that mistake was made from the consultant due to which my transfer was not processed. even I tried the number from which I received a call-it was from UAE. wasted couple of dollars on the call and waited for 15 mins on the call- no answered, so hung up the call. so after going through all the hassle, finally my brother received a money. no one from UAE team came forward to help. very poor service.",0

6675,"I have made a transfer on the 15th of May , to my account in Srilanka , this transfer was suppise to be a flash transfer and i was told that it will take 10-15 minutes to reach my account. The next day morning i was suppose to pay for a chq and the money has not reached my account (chq got bounced) , I have called the UAE exchange and they confirmed the payment being transferred from their end and confirmed the issue is with the local bank. I have spent hours and hours on roaming calls to figure out what has happened. Local bank confirmed not recieving the funds from the corresponding banking facility which is uae exchange again. I have made 4 calls to uae exchange they have given me contradicting answers but denied the fact that there is an issue from their end. Instead given me promises with different timings. Eventually when i went to the branch where i made the deposit i was promised this will be cleared by today .. as at now there is no funds.. and i got a call today from uae exchange and the caller states there is a technical issue from both the ends. End of the day i know for a fact that these ppl are bluffing and dont know anything about whats going on. They dont even know how the corresponding banking takes place for this particular transfers. I have all these calls recorded, which they have given me different timings and lieng to me on the situation. I am anyway planning to raise this issue to the attention of the financial ombudsman and the central bank. It is very dissapointing that im struggling to get my own funds and being fooled ny a set of people.",0

6708,"Update on my previous post on 08 May 2018; Following previous post , customer service of UAE Exchange contact me within 2 hours. Informed me almost every hour about the progress. And after one month I received back my funds in my bank account. That experience was excellent but I wish the lack of communication I highlighted below didn't happen in the first place. Previous post & facts; 17 March 2018;Initiated an online transfer to my own account back home. 19 March 2018 ;They debited my account 03 April 2018 ; Back from holiday noticing that the money still didn't reach I called back. They requested information which provided already online. 05 April 2018 ; I called them back; another set of information request. I got upset and asked for cancellation of the transaction.( I allowed them to direct debit from my salary account) Got an acknowledgment e mail.( Request id **2888353**) After this called them every 3-4 days . Always pretending that it would be refunded back within ""2-3 working days "" that never comes. Each time confirming that they don't need any further information from my side. Holding my money almost two months now. Terrible service/ no service at all. Not possible to get any information. They never call you back , and you need to go thru all the way from day 1. Still not solved as of today 08 May 2018 !",2

6733,"I had a bad experience for the first time during my last visit to International city branch during April. An employee named Mz Gul was on the counter I chose. She was constantly bothered by someone counting cash and discussing numbers with her while she could not understand What I was saying in English. In the end, I asked her to deposit AED 3,000/- on my second transaction and also showed 3 using my fingers but she still deposited 2,800/-. This is the first time someone is performing a wrong request for me in this branch and also went on to say that she can deposit remaining 200/- if Im ready to pay extra service fees. I believe that if she could have understood What Im requesting like others or if she was focused on her job, this could have been avoided. Although I never faced problems with language before, I have been irritated before when the person is talking with someone else. When you are talking to a customer, they should be given priority. Kindly see if you can have all staffs able to understand English on all counters and also make a policy not to be bothered by colleagues while providing services to customers. However, I will continue visiting this branch because of convenience and past happy customer services.",2

On the contarary to the promise through the advertisement regarding unused currency buy back at the same rate paid at the purchase time, they deduct huge money while buying the unused currency of their choice and thus mislead people like us who are regular customer.

6862,Always had good relation with uae exchange till last week I send money to my brother in Canada from your JLT branch. The person at counter was having a personal conversation with some girl and had to wait till they finish then he needed my Emirates ID and forgot to give back so i had to go back to get it. Then today after 5 days I get a call saying I have to provide transit account number inorder to process the payment. When I asked it is she knows nothing more. This was the 4th time i am sending money to the same account in last 1 years time. I gave the receipt of last transaction to replicate transaction what more? My brother was calling me for last 3 days asking for money and now I have to go through all over again. One inefficient branch like JLT is causing you loose a customer like me.,2
6863,easy access and very approachable keep it up guys,2
6864,"In general my review to the UAE exchange and its service is 5 STARS from my experience with them for the past 20 years, but today i am forced to give 1 STAR because of my recent experience where they prove me i am stupid. I subscribed and enrolled to their online money transfer service using their newly developed mobile app, i got all the information and instruction from their customer service via telephone, and approached one of their branch to fill in all required documents, including signed off auto debit from so that allows them to debit from my bank whatever amount i would send as remittance, i applied 22 March 2018, and today 9 April 2018 and every time i had to follow up and they would never bother to call me back, although their representatives keep promising they will call back within an hour but this never happened, so after so many days and so many follow up from the customer side i found out that my direct debit document which i signed at their branch was submitted or uploaded to their system without their branch seal or stamp and rejected follow day, and after that i was not even informed what is going on, but instead whenever i call they would say we will call you back in sometime but again never happened........... so after so many times calling to their customer service as well as branch officer i do not see any progress on this and my service is activated since i subscribed but i cannot send any money? This is very serious matter and have me think of choosing another service provider. To clarify further, my location is UAE and not South Africa as shown in here",0

6909,"I got a warm experience from SAIF Zone branch officer Ramakrishnan, he listened carefully about my issue,and cleared my issue that i faced for a long time. Initially i am talking with a guy Naveen on the same branch he didn't have any time to listen me. Kindly teach him, If a customer is in front of him try to listen at least 5 Minutes. I came the branch to resolve my issue because i paid money on your desk. When he transferred from this branch soon my issue has been resolved. He is doing Language Proficiency test in your branch, when i started to speak in Malayalam he thought talking in Malayalam will not trouble the customer so he started speaking English. when i started following him the he moved into Hindi, again i forced to follow him, for your kind information, I am an engineering dropout and i font have proficiency in many languages, i never think that this is the way of talking to a customer. when he transferred from the branch few days after i got call from Jessy customer care officer and she asked me to contact Sheelu branch officer for the updates of my complaint. After a few days later i got my issue cleared. thanks to all people who helped me to get out of this issue. Thanks to Jessy, Sheelu, Sukanya and Ramakrishnan. I am totally disagreeing with the ""NO"" man Naveen. For all type of quires he had only one answer I don't know, we don't know, I can't do anything, I am helpless. Take a taxi and go to Dubai and ask to SBI people to clear you issue or ask your wife to run across all the branches of SBI from Trivandrum to Kasargod, go to the hell",2
6910,"This is the continuation of my previous review. I had given the certificate attestation on 27th feb in kundapur branch. They have promised me to give it back by 15 days. Till 21st March the guy with whom I had given did not follow up the things and when I wrote the review suddenly they called from head office and told it's ready and they are going to courier it directly to Dubai. And sales guy told me I have to pay 2800 INR towards the courier charges. But courier like professional courier charging around 1500 he told me their company insisted him to send it in DHL. and today I got call from their head office and they told I have to pay 2800. Now the point is: If they did their work on time it was not going to happened. For their mistake I got delay in my visa status change, upon that I have to pay 2800 extra from my pocket. And when we are having cheaper courier service why only DHL. That too I clearly told sales guy u can send it in cheaper courier. But he is telling they are going to send it by DHL. Here money is not a matter. I will pay it. But make sure that don't make anyone to pay extra for Ur stupidity. And now please don't call and try to give the reason.",0
